                                    In this intensive course the students are taught HTML, CSS, SCSS, 
                                    Bootstrap, JavaScript, Angular, and React to name a few. Students form teams 
                                    with other students to make websites and web applications. As well as an 
                                    externship at the end of the cohort. By the end of the course all students have 
                                    the abilities to find a job as an entry level or junior level developer

                                <p>
                                    I advance my knowledge by studying in my free time. The things I study 
                                    are Rust, ML, and Web development. I read the Rust book and watch videos 
                                    about the unsafe features of Rust which are very useful. I read books about ML 
                                    in which its contents are usually about Scikit-learn, which is a library that 
                                    implements learning algorithms. I'm planning on implementing ML algorithms 
                                    from scratch and advancing my knowledge in statistics and algebra to 
                                    understand what’s under the hood more. I learn web development by making 
                                    websites which is the only good way to learn it, by practicing and searching up 
                                    how to implement an aspect of a website.

                            buy lots more food for them, there are many venezuelan immigrants there

                        <h5>I LOVE CODE:</h5>
                        <p>
                            I started coding when I was around 12, I was watching videos on youtube and 
                            then I found a video about a story about two guys who supposedly found a sentient AI. 
                            At first the AI asked questions like “What’s your favorite ice cream flavor”, but then it 
                            asked the question “What’s it like outside this box?”. I don’t know what it was about 
                            this question but it awoke a sense of curiosity. I just wanted to know more about the 
                            curiosity behind the question the AI asked, so that day I got on the computer and 
                            started learning programming. I started to code in my free time, at first it was confusing 
                            learning but eventually it wasn’t that confusing, I really fell in love with programming 
                            and started learning new languages.

                        <h5>I LOVE CHAINSAW:</h5>
                        <p>
                            I love this manga called Chainsaw Man, to spare some details I won’t go into it 
                            too much but essentially it’s about the main character Denji and what he wants to 
                            become in life and accomplish. He is a very flawed character and does things that are 
                            not very good but he tries to improve on it. At the end of Chainsaw Man Part 1 even 
                            though it was in the span of 2 years he still isn't a very good person, but he does 
                            reflect on everything that he’s done wrong, he knows he’ll mess up in the future but he 
                            still wants to improve himself. I take this as inspiration because Denji never started 
                            well. I’m not very good at math but I want to become a Machine learning engineer. I'm 
                            not going to start off as the best and It’s going to take a long time but I want to improve 
                            myself no matter how long it takes.

                        <p>
                            I probably program in Rust more than any other programming language.
                            The main reason why I use Rust is memory safety and because of that many companies
                            are adopting Rust for production. I am currently learning Rust and hope to learn
                            web assembly with it.

                            I have been programming is JS for a while and have been using it in the 
                            course I'm taking. I am comfortable with it's syntax and implementing algorithms
                            with JS.

                            I am very familiar and comfartable with using HTML. I am confident in my ability to
                            structure a website well. I also know Bootstrap which is how I made this website.

                            because of a course I'm taking. I know SASS, and I'm comfortable with
                            making animations with CSS.
